    Not much is decided yet about next year's GIMP developers
    conference execpt that there should be one. We are still looking
    for a host for GIMPCon 2004. It is our goal to bring all active
    GIMP and GEGL developers together. So we are looking for sponsors
    to fund travel costs and accommodation. If you think you can help,
    please let us know.
