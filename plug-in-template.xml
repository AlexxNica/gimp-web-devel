    The GIMP Plug-In Template is an empty GIMP Plug-In that does
    nothing. It also has a GUI that allows to control how it achieves
    this task. But best of all, it comes with a complete setup for
    autoconf, automake, internationalisation and all these things you
    never wanted to know about.

    Thanks to the GIMP Plug-In Template you don't need to worry about
    all these things. Just download the tarball, add some magic image
    manipulation routines and voil√†, your own GIMP plug-in:
