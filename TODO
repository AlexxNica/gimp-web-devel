TODO for developer.gimp.org
---------------------------

Just some ideas in case anyone feels bored. Feel free to add more.

- Integrate or at least link to Simon's fabulous talk about
  plug-in programming:
  http://www.home.unix-ag.org/simon/gimp/guadec2002/gimp-plugin/html/
  This talk is available in DocBook also.

- Add a list of links to photo galleries with Camp pictures (this
  probably includes asking Sven to put his Camp photos back online).

- Converting the site to a table-less layout might be desirable.

- Consider a news system (using RSS ?!) for regular updates on GIMP
  development.

- Add a developers FAQ. Check out what can be reused from
  http://www.rru.com/~meo/gimp/faq-dev.html

- Integrate the XML source of the API reference manuals
  (gimp/devel-docs) so they fit better into the look of the
  site. Alternatively hack gtk-doc to allow for external CSS
  stylesheets.

- add custom xsl templates for mediaobject, orderedlist and itemized
  list to produce valid xhtml (remove the <div></div> stuff).
